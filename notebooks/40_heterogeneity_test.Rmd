# Testing for tissue heterogeneity

## Tissue signatures {#sec:signatures}

In section \@ref(validating-signatures), we identified a set of
9 *reference signatures* (table \@ref(tab:refsig)) which unambiguously
identify their corresponding tissue across platforms and species. In addition to that, 
we use 120 tissue signatures from the BioQC publication, which we refer to as *query signatures*. 

```{r refsig, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tmp_ref_sig = reference_signatures
colnames(tmp_ref_sig) = c("Reference Signature", "Tissue")
knitr::kable(tmp_ref_sig, caption="reference signatures")
```


## Testing samples for heterogeneity
We tested for enrichment of
`r sum(str_detect(selected_signatures$SIGNATURE, "BIOQC"))`
selected signatures provided by BioQC, the
`r sum(str_detect(selected_signatures$SIGNATURE, "GTEX"))`
reference signatures generated by us and one random control signature of
100 randomly drawn genes on all `r nrow(bioqc_meta)` selected samples
resulting in a list of `r nrow(data2)` (sample, signature, pvalue) pairs.
This process is described in detail in section \@ref(sample-processing).

Our intention is to identify samples that show *tissue heterogeneity*,
*i.e.* unintentional profiling of cells of other origin than the target tissue
of profiling. We classify samples into *heterogenous* and *not heterogenous*.
We call a classification *true-positive* if the given sample is classified
as *heterogenous* and the sample indeed contains cells different from the
annotated tissues. Analogous, we call a classification *false-positive*
if the given sample is classified as *heterogenous* but in reality only contains cells from the annotated tissue.

Naively, we would label a sample as heterogenous, if a signature unrelated
to the annotated tissue exceeds a certain score. The problem with this
approach is, that some signatures overlap; the resulting scores are therefore
correlated and will lead to false-positives. One cannot simply solve this
problem by excuding genes that are members of multiple signatures, as it is
easily possible to build two (in fact many) distinct, non-overlapping
signatures matching the same tissue.

In section \@ref(validating-signatures) we haven created toroughly validated
*reference signatures* for 9 tissues. Even though we have demonstrated that
each signature unambigously identifies its corresponding tissue (*i.e.* scores
highest), the signatures could still be correlated. Some of them in fact are,
e.g. cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle (see figure
\@ref(fig:correlationexample)). Moreover, we lack sufficient data to perform an
independent-sample validation on the signatures provided by BioQC. Accounting
for correlation with the reference signatures, we can still avoid
false-positives, even if a signature is characteristic for a tissue
histologically close to the annotated tissue.

We therefore take the following approach to account for the correlation of signatures:
A given sample $s$ annotated as tissue $t$ is tested for enrichment with signature $k_{\text{test}}$ resulting in a p-value $p_{\text{test}}$. Let $k_{\text{ref}}$ be the reference signature associated with tissue $t$ and $p_{\text{ref}}$ the p-value of testing $s$ for enrichment of $k_{\text{ref}}$. Let $\tau$ be a certain false discovery rate (FDR)-threshold.

(1) If the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted $p_{\text{test}} \ge \tau$, we
assume that $s$ is not heterogenous; else continue.
(2) We fit a linear model using `rlm` from the `R` `MASS` package of
$|log10(p_{\text{test}})|$ against $|log10(p_{\text{ref}})|$ for all samples
annotated as $t$. We assume that the residuals $R$ of the linear model follow
a normal distribution $R \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$, where $\sigma$ is the
standard deviation of the residuals.
(3) We extract the residual $r$ corresponding to sample $s$. We calculate the
p-value $p_{\text{corr}} = 1 - \text{CDF}_R(r)$ where $\text{CDF}_R$ is the
cumulative density function of $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
(4) If the BH-adjusted $p_{\text{corr}} < \tau$, we reject the
hypothesis that $k_{\text{test}}$ is enriched only due to correlation and label
the sample as heterogenous.

### Determining $\tau$.
We desire an overall FDR of `r FDR_THRES`. Since we test in a two-step procedure, we choose a threshold $\tau$, such that the
overall FDR equals `r FDR_THRES`.

$$
\text{FDR} = \tau + (1-\tau) \tau
$$
Explanation:
Of all positives in step 1, there are, per definition, a fraction of $\tau$ false-positives and $1-\tau$ true-positives.
To all positives, the step 2 test is applied. In addition to the false-positives from step 1, there is a fraction of $\tau(1-\tau)$ false-positives among the true-positives from step 1.

Solving the equation yields:
$$
`r FDR_THRES` = \tau + (1-\tau)\tau \Leftrightarrow 0 = \tau^2 - 2\tau + `r FDR_THRES`
$$
```{r get-tau}
tau = polyroot(c(FDR_THRES, -2, 1))[1]
tau
```
