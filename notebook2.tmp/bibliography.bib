Initially, this resource would enable the research community to perform a com-prehensive search for eQTLs (both tissue-type specific and across tissue types) and estab-lish their association with disease-associated variants from GWAS or sequencing studies. Eventually, as other molecular phenotypes are added, the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression could expand to include correlations with epigenetics and proteomics data as well as other molecu-lar characteristics. Although such a catalog would have been unthinkable a few years ago, new genomic technologies are now making the problem approachable. This convergence of unmet scientific need and new technologies prompted a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop held in June 2008 to discuss the advisability and fea-sibility of a large-scale public resource for human genetic variation and gene expression across tissues. On the basis of the output from this workshop and ongoing consultation, the NIH developed the concept of the GTEx proj-ect (Box 1). Many of the specifics of the pilot project described here were contributed by funded investigators and were influenced by early, experimental biospecimen collections.},

@article{Itadani2008,
abstract = {Cancer is thought to be caused by a sequence of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations which occur in one or more of the genes controlling cell cycle progression and signaling transduction. The complexity of carcinogenic mechanisms leads to heterogeneity in molecular phenotype, pathology, and prognosis of cancers.Genome-wide mutational analysis of cancer genes in individual tumors is the most direct way to elucidate the complex process of disease progression, although such high-throughput sequencing technologies are not yet fully developed. As a surrogate marker for pathway activation analysis, expression profiling using microarrays has been successfully applied for the classification of tumor types, stages of tumor progression, or in some cases, prediction of clinical outcomes. However, the biological implication of those gene expression signatures is often unclear. Systems biological approaches leverage the signature genes as a representation of changes in signaling pathways, instead of interpreting the relevance between each gene and phenotype. This approach, which can be achieved by comparing the gene set or the expression profile with those of reference experiments in which a defined pathway is modulated, will improve our understanding of cancer classification, clinical outcome, and carcinogenesis. In this review, we will discuss recent studies on the development of expression signatures to monitor signaling pathway activities and how these signatures can be used to improve the identification of responders to anticancer drugs.},

@article{Venet2011,
abstract = {Bridging the gap between animal or in vitro models and human disease is essential in medical research. Researchers often suggest that a biological mechanism is relevant to human cancer from the statistical association of a gene expression marker (a signature) of this mechanism, that was discovered in an experimental system, with disease outcome in humans. We examined this argument for breast cancer. Surprisingly, we found that gene expression signatures-unrelated to cancer-of the effect of postprandial laughter, of mice social defeat and of skin fibroblast localization were all significantly associated with breast cancer outcome. We next compared 47 published breast cancer outcome signatures to signatures made of random genes. Twenty-eight of them (60{\%}) were not significantly better outcome predictors than random signatures of identical size and 11 (23{\%}) were worst predictors than the median random signature. More than 90{\%} of random signatures {\textgreater}100 genes were significant outcome predictors. We next derived a metagene, called meta-PCNA, by selecting the 1{\%} genes most positively correlated with proliferation marker PCNA in a compendium of normal tissues expression. Adjusting breast cancer expression data for meta-PCNA abrogated almost entirely the outcome association of published and random signatures. We also found that, in the absence of adjustment, the hazard ratio of outcome association of a signature strongly correlated with meta-PCNA (R(2) = 0.9). This relation also applied to single-gene expression markers. Moreover, {\textgreater}50{\%} of the breast cancer transcriptome was correlated with meta-PCNA. A corollary was that purging cell cycle genes out of a signature failed to rule out the confounding effect of proliferation. Hence, it is questionable to suggest that a mechanism is relevant to human breast cancer from the finding that a gene expression marker for this mechanism predicts human breast cancer outcome, because most markers do. The methods we present help to overcome this problem.},

@article{Gonen2009,
abstract = {Evolution of high-throughput technologies has enabled us to quantify several thousands of gene expressions simultaneously. Several oncologic applications have emerged, two of which will be discussed: developing gene signatures and finding molecular targets. This article emphasizes the different nature of statisitical methods used and required for developing gene signatures and identifying molecular targets. Routine and careful consideration of validation methods are essential for developing gene signatures. Choice of model development methodology seems to be less critical. Because of the way gene signatures are developed, even after careful validation, it is unlikely that they will yield a direct link to molecular targets. Identifying molecular targets will require more careful and focused experimentation than large-sample microarray studies.},

@article{Ioannidis2009,
abstract = {Given the complexity of microarray-based gene expression studies, guidelines encourage transparent design and public data availability. Several journals require public data deposition and several public databases exist. However, not all data are publicly available, and even when available, it is unknown whether the published results are reproducible by independent scientists. Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

@article{Irizarry2009,
abstract = {Although pyruvate carboxylase associated with both mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase, it had a higher affinity for the amino-transferase. Furthermore, the aminotransferase enhanced dissociation of malate dehydrogenase from pyruvate carboxylase. Glutamate dehydrogenase did not associate with pyruvate carboxylase alone, but it apparently associated with the pyruvate carboxylase-aminotransferase complex, and malate dehydrogenase associated with the resulting ternary complex. Citrate synthase and other proteins tested did not associate with pyruvate carboxylase. However, citrate synthase associated with the pyruvate carboxylase-malate dehydrogenase complex. Apparently as a consequence of these heteroenzyme interactions, the rate of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was slightly greater when coupled with malate dehydrogenase or both malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase than when coupled with citrate synthase alone. In addition, in the presence of both coupling enzymes, the rate of conversion of pyruvate to citrate was higher than predicted on the basis of the Michaelis-Menten relationship of the two coupling enzymes. Therefore, binding of malate dehydrogenase to pyruvate carboxylase enhances pyruvate carboxylase activity. Association of citrate synthase with the malate dehydrogenase-pyruvate carboxylase binary complex does not alter activation of pyruvate carboxylase but results in citrate synthase being more reactive than free citrate synthase with oxalacetate.},
