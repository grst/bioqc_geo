Same as in the section before, but all bioqc signatures aggregated by tissue groups.
Additional, we define samples as being "severely heterogeneous", if the reference signature,
i.e. the signature that should be present according to the annotation, is not enriched at
an unadjusted p-value < 0.05.







We use bootstrapping (R package `boot`) to derive confidence intervals.
