## Tissue signatures {#sec:signatures}

In section \@ref(validating-signatures), we identified a set of
9 *reference signatures* (table \@ref(tab:refsig)) which unambiguously
identify their corresponding tissue across platforms and species. In addition to that, 
we use 120 tissue signatures from the BioQC publication, which we refer to as *query signatures*.

## Testing samples for heterogeneity







We tested for enrichment of 120
selected signatures provided by BioQC (query signatures) and the 9
reference signatures generated by us on all  76576
selected samples resulting in a list of 9878304 
(sample, signature, pvalue) pairs.

Our intention is to identify samples that show *tissue heterogeneity*,
*i.e.* unintentional profiling of cells of other origin than the target tissue
of profiling. We classify samples into *heterogeneous* and *not heterogeneous*.
We call a classification *true-positive* if the given sample is classified
as *heterogeneous* and the sample indeed contains cells different from the
annotated tissues. Analogous, we call a classification *false-positive*
if the given sample is classified as *heterogeneous* but in reality only contains cells from the annotated tissue.

Naively, we could label a sample as heterogeneous, if a signature unrelated
to the annotated tissue exceeds a certain score. The problem with this
approach is, that some signatures overlap; the resulting scores are therefore
correlated and will lead to false-positives. One cannot simply solve this
problem by excluding genes that are members of multiple signatures, as it is
easily possible to build two (in fact many) distinct, non-overlapping
signatures matching the same tissue, due to gene-gene correlation. 

In section \@ref(validating-signatures) we have created and validated
*reference signatures* for 9 tissues. Even though we have demonstrated that
each signature unambiguously identifies its corresponding tissue (*i.e.* scores
highest), the signatures could still be correlated. Some of them in fact are,
e.g. cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle (see figure
\@ref(fig:correlationexample)). Moreover, we lack sufficient data to perform an
independent-sample validation on the signatures provided by BioQC.  
Therefore, to avoid false-positives, for each tissue, we exclude all signature
that are positively correlated with the reference signature. This approach is
more formally described in the following: 

A given sample $s$ annotated as tissue $t$ is tested for enrichment with signature $k_{\text{query}}$ resulting in a p-value $p_{\text{query}}$. Let $k_{\text{ref}}$ be the reference signature associated with tissue $t$ and $p_{\text{ref}}$ the p-value of testing $s$ for enrichment of $k_{\text{ref}}$. Let $\tau$ be a certain false discovery rate (FDR)-threshold (0.01 in this study).

(1) If the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted $p_{\text{query}} \ge \tau$, we
assume that $s$ is not heterogeneous; else continue.
(2) We fit a robust linear model using `rlm` from the `R` `MASS` package of
$|log10(p_{\text{query}})|$ against $|log10(p_{\text{ref}})|$ for all samples
annotated as $t$. 
(3) If the slope of the linear model is  $\ge 0.01$, we exclude the pair of
signatures from the results. If the slope is $< 0.01$ and the FDR-adjusted $p_{\text{query}} < \tau$, 
we consider the sample as heterogeneous. Tissue pairs for which signatures are excluded are 
marked as such in the results. 
(4) We define heterogeneity as *severe*, if additionally $p_{\text{ref}} \ge$ 0.05.

# Additional Results

## Distribution of heterogeneity across studies




Figure \@ref(fig:heterogeneitystudy) shows that heterogeneity is not equally distributed along studies. In fact, most studies (84.9% GEO, 74.7% ARCHS4) contain no samples with detected heterogeneity and only a small percentage (5.7% GEO, 7.3% ARCHS4) contain "severely heterogeneous" samples.

## Heterogeneity along time

Next, we were interested if heterogeneity increases over time. Figure \@ref(fig:hetereogeneityyear) shows the heterogeneity fractions 
per year and tissue. While there is some variance between years, there appears to be no clear trend over time.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:hetereogeneityyear)Fractions of heterogeneous and severely heterogeneous samples by year.</p>
</div>


To formally test the hypothesis that heterogeneity is associated with a time variable, we fitted a linear model (`heterogeneity ~ year + tissue`)
and checked the `year` coefficient (table \@ref(tab:yearlmres)). There appears to be no significant association of time with heterogeneity.
