Results suggest, that between 2 and 6 percent of all samples in GEO show tissue heterogeneity. A major source of heterogeneity appear to be blood mononuclear cells.

Figure \@ref(fig:heterogeneitygtex) shows the number of samples detected as heterogenous with the reference signatures only. Figure \@ref(fig:heterogeneityall) shows the number of samples classified as heterogeneous with the signatures provided by BioQC. Figure \@ref(fig:heterogeneitybar) shows the fraction of heterogenous samples per tissue, taking all signatures into account.
