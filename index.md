# BioQC GEO Analysis

This document is supplementary information for

> Sturm, G and Zhang, JD. A prevalence of tissue heterogeneity in gene
> expression data. *Manuscript in preparation*.

This document demonstrates step-by-step how we generated and validated
tissue signatures, curated data and derive our results.
