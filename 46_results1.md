\caption{Tissue heterogeneity assessed with the reference signatures. The annotated tissues are listed in rows, the significantly enriched signatures in columns. If a signature has been found to be significantly enriched in a sample, the sample will count towards the number indicated in the matrix. All contaminations per sample are included, i.e. a sample can appear multiple times in a row. }(\#fig:heterogeneitygtexfig)

## Heterogeneity using all signatures

See figures \@ref(fig:heterogeneityall1), \@ref(fig:heterogeneityall2), \@ref(fig:heterogeneityall3), and \@ref(fig:heterogeneityall4).
